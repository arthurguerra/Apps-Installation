# Applications Setup

This repo is a shortcut for apps installation on brand new environments.

Just run `./apps-setup.sh` to begin the installation of many useful programs
on your OS. After the script is done, everything will be correctly configured. 

It also sets `zsh` as your default bash.

No need to manually download packages for each application again =)

Thanks to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and 
[Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) that do all the heavy 
work for us!
